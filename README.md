# Yorot Standart

Version: 1.0

This centralized library is used by and for:
- Yorot flavors (such as [Yorot Avalonia](https://github.com/haltroy-yorot/Yorot-Avalonia))
- Yorot Extensions
- Yorot Apps
- Apps that use Yorot as rendering & logic.

## Development

This library is developed with C# programming language, thus requires
.NET SDK to be installed on your computer. We recommend the latest version as always.

This library uses .NET Standard 2.0, which is compatible with lots of .NET
technologies. The list can be found [`here`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-2-0#select-net-standard-version).

**NOTE:** We highly recommend using .NET Core 3.1/.NET 5 and newer .NET versions instead of .NET Framework for cross-platform capabilities.
